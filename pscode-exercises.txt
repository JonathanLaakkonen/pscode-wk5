// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

Input(x) + Input(y) = Result

// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is even or odd

if (number / 2) == Zero, print(This number is even). Else, print(this number is odd)

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

a) Input(1), Input(2), Input(3), Input(4), Input(5)
b) (( Input(1) + Input(2) + Input(3) + Input(4) + Input(5) ))/ 5 = Result1
c) Use Elif statements to compare the numbers and find which one is largest, call this Result2.
   Use Elif statements to compare the numbers and find which one is smallest, call this Result3
d) print(The average of these numbers is ) + Result1 + (, The largest of the numbers is ) + Result2 + (, the smallest of these numbers is ) + Result3
